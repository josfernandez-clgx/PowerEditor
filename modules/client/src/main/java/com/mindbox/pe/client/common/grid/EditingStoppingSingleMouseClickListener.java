/**
 * Mouse listener that stoppes table cell editing on single click.
 * 
 * DAB: there is an issue with the ActionListener on the grid button
 * firing the action event during a double click.  Using the below MouseListener
 * alleviates the problem.  Old behavior in newer JREs was that the action cleared
 * out the enumValues before the double-click handler took effect.
 *  
 *  @since 5.8.0
